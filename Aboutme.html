                <p>
  Hi, my name is Leul Negash Anteneh. I am a passionate Computer Science student with a growing interest in web development, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving through technology. I enjoy learning by building real projects and challenging myself to create clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.</br>
  Beyond coding, I value curiosity and creativity, always looking for ways to connect what I learn to real-world impact. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to projects that make people’s lives easier and better.</br>
  When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, collaborating with others, and continuously improving myself both personally and professionally.
